# Alarm-Clock-project

<i>We want to develop software for an alarm clock.
The clock shows the time of day. Using buttons, the user can set the hours and minutes fields individually,
and choose between 12 and 24-hour display.
It is possible to set one or two alarms. When an alarm fires, it will sound some noise. The user can turn it off,
or choose to “snooze”. If the user does not respond at all, the alarm will turn off itself after 2 minutes.
“Snoozing” means to turn off the sound, but the alarm will fire again after some minutes of delay. This
“snoozing time” is pre-adjustable.</i>

## Use Case Description
<i>
The Alarm Clock is designed to have several functions like checking the current time and set an alarm. The users can set the time format by using the button. The clock provides 12hr and 24hr time format. It is possible to set 1 or 2 alarms. When the alarm starts, user is able to turn it off or snooze. If the clock got no response from the user, it will be turned off automatically in 2 minutes. If the user snoozed the clock, the sound would be turned off and the clock would fire again after snoozing time. Also, the snoozing time can be adjusted.
